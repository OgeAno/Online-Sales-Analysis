# Online-Sales-Analysis
## An analysis of a webshop's sales over a 2-year period   
I did his project for a a UK-based online retailer that sells mainly unique all-occasion gifts. The goal of the project was to give the company a high level overview of their sales performance for the 2018 to 2019 period. They provided me with their sales data for the preceding two years (2018 and 2019). I used Python for data cleaning and preparation. The Jupyter Notebook shows the data cleaning steps I took in Python.
After I was done with data cleaning, I exported the cleaned dataset to PowerBI for visualisation.
