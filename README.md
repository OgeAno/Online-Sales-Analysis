# Online-Sales-Analysis
## An analysis of a webshop's sales over a 2-year period   
I did this project for a UK-based online retailer that sells mainly unique all-occasion gifts. The goal of the project was to give the company a high level overview of their sales performance for the 2018 to 2019 period. They provided me with 2 datasets; one containing 2018 sales records and one containing 2019 sales records. I used Python for data cleaning and preparation. The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/OgeAno/Online-Sales-Analysis/blob/07d4bada736bb6b7c5b999f1785c78149b0fd039/Online_Sales_Analysis.ipynb) shows the data cleaning steps I took in Python.
After I was done with data cleaning, I exported the cleaned dataset to PowerBI for visualisation.
